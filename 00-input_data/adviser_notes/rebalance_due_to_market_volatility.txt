Following the recent spike in market volatility triggered by geopolitical tensions and rising inflation concerns, it is recommended that the client's portfolio be rebalanced to maintain their moderate risk profile.

Currently, the client's equity allocation has drifted from the target 60% to approximately 72%, primarily due to the outperformance of technology and healthcare sectors. While these gains are welcome, the increased exposure to equities heightens overall portfolio risk.

Recommendation:
- Reduce equity holdings by approximately 12%, primarily trimming overweight positions in high-growth sectors.
- Increase bond allocation to restore portfolio stability. Recommended bond instruments include a mix of government securities and high-quality corporate bonds, emphasizing intermediate maturities.
- Retain exposure to growth sectors but cap any single sector to no more than 20% of the total portfolio to mitigate concentration risk.

Timing:
- Execute rebalancing over the next two weeks in a phased manner to avoid adverse price impacts.

Additional Considerations:
- Review cash reserves to ensure at least six months' worth of living expenses are readily accessible, given the uncertain economic outlook.
- Evaluate adding a small allocation (around 5%) to inflation-protected securities to hedge against prolonged inflation risks.

Follow-up:
- Schedule a portfolio review meeting in three months to reassess asset allocation and market conditions.

By taking a disciplined approach to rebalancing, the client can lock in recent gains, reduce downside risk, and maintain alignment with their long-term financial objectives.
