Discovering an unauthorized transaction can be distressing. However, financial institutions offer structured dispute processes designed to protect consumers.
        
Once you identify a suspicious charge, report it immediately through your banking app or by calling the fraud hotline. Some banks allow dispute initiation directly through their transaction history pages.
        
Provide specific details such as transaction amount, date, merchant information, and any contextual information (e.g., “I was traveling overseas at that time”). Supporting documents strengthen your case.
        
Under most regulations, like the U.S. Electronic Fund Transfer Act, you have up to 60 days after a statement is issued to report errors or unauthorized transactions. Some banks extend provisional credit within a few days while they investigate, easing financial strain during the process.
        
The investigation can take from 10 to 45 days depending on complexity. During this time, continue monitoring your account for additional unauthorized activities.
        
Upon conclusion, you’ll receive a written explanation of the decision. If your claim is validated, the provisional credit becomes permanent. Otherwise, you may dispute the outcome again or escalate to financial regulatory bodies.
        
Proactive reporting and thorough documentation ensure the highest likelihood of a favorable resolution.
