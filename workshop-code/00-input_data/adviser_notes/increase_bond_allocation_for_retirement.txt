As the client approaches retirement within the next five years, a strategic shift towards more conservative investments is advised to preserve capital and ensure predictable income streams.

Current Situation:
- Portfolio composition is 65% equities and 35% bonds.
- The client has expressed a preference for reducing exposure to market volatility as retirement nears.

Recommendation:
- Increase bond allocation from 35% to 55% over the next 12 months.
- Focus bond investments on high-grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds (where applicable for tax efficiency), and U.S. Treasury securities.
- Gradually reduce equity holdings, prioritizing sales of high-volatility assets first.

Income Strategy:
- Develop a bond ladder strategy to provide regular income without locking funds in low-yield long-term securities.
- Consider incorporating dividend-paying blue-chip stocks for additional income with relatively lower volatility.

Risk Mitigation:
- Diversify bond holdings across sectors and credit qualities to minimize risk.
- Avoid overconcentration in any single bond issuer.

Monitoring:
- Review the portfolio quarterly to ensure that the transition is proceeding smoothly.
- Adjust allocation targets based on market conditions and changing client needs.

By proactively adjusting the portfolio now, the client can enjoy greater financial security and peace of mind during retirement years.
