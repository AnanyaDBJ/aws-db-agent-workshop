If you notice any unauthorized transaction on your account, the first and most critical action is to freeze your card immediately. Swift action can prevent further fraudulent activities and limit the potential financial damage. 
        
Most banking institutions today offer mobile apps that allow you to instantly freeze your card without needing to speak to a customer representative. Freezing the card disables all transactions, both online and offline. This includes recurring payments, new purchases, and withdrawals. However, it does not affect standing instructions for utilities or pre-approved debits unless you specifically instruct the bank.
        
In the case where mobile app access is unavailable, call the 24/7 customer hotline listed at the back of your card. Always ensure you are calling the authentic number to avoid falling prey to secondary fraud.
        
Once your card is frozen, report the suspicious transaction through official channels. Provide as much detail as possible: the transaction amount, date, merchant, and any associated messages you received. Some banks may ask you to file an official dispute form online or visit a branch.
        
It’s important to monitor your account closely for a few weeks even after freezing the card, as fraudsters sometimes attempt secondary attacks. Set up transaction alerts via SMS or email so you’re notified instantly if any new activity happens on your account.
        
Upon verification, your bank will typically issue a replacement card within 5 to 7 business days. They may also provide provisional credits depending on the fraud investigation outcome.
        
Remember, freezing your card immediately is the first shield in defending your financial assets against fraud. Stay vigilant, and act promptly at the first sign of suspicious activity.
