Phishing is one of the most common tactics fraudsters use to obtain personal information. Recognizing and responding correctly to phishing attempts can prevent identity theft and significant financial damage.
        
Phishing attempts often appear as legitimate emails, SMS messages, or even phone calls pretending to be from trusted organizations. These messages typically create urgency — warning you about 'suspicious activity' or promising rewards — and ask you to click a link or provide sensitive information.
        
Never click on links or open attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Authentic institutions will never ask you for full passwords, Social Security numbers, or account PINs via email or text. 
        
If you receive a suspicious communication, do not engage. Forward the email or message to your institution’s phishing report address. For example, at TrustSecure Financial, forward suspicious emails to phishing@trustsecure.com.
        
If you believe you have inadvertently responded to a phishing attempt, immediately change your passwords for all sensitive accounts and alert your financial institutions.
