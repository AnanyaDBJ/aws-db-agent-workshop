Following an incident of fraud, it’s vital to increase account monitoring to prevent additional breaches.
        
Immediately after resolving the initial incident — freezing your card and reporting the fraudulent transaction — set up real-time transaction alerts on all your financial accounts. Many banks allow you to customize thresholds for notifications so that you are informed instantly of even small transactions.
        
Consider changing online banking passwords, especially if there is any possibility that login credentials were compromised.
        
Enroll in credit monitoring services, many of which are offered free by financial institutions post-fraud incidents. These services can alert you to new account openings, credit inquiries, and other suspicious activity tied to your identity.
        
Review your bank and credit card statements weekly for at least 90 days after the initial fraud incident. Look for any small unauthorized transactions — fraudsters sometimes "test the waters" with low-dollar charges before launching a major attack.
        
File a fraud alert with one of the major credit bureaus. This measure makes it harder for fraudsters to open accounts in your name.
        
By staying vigilant and proactive, you minimize long-term damage and reinforce your financial security.
