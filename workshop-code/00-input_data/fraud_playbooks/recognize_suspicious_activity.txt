Detecting suspicious activity early can make the difference between minor inconvenience and major financial loss. 
        
Look out for unusual purchase patterns such as sudden high-value transactions, small test purchases, or multiple transactions at unfamiliar merchants. Fraudsters often perform 'test runs' with small purchases before initiating larger theft.
        
Other red flags include foreign transactions from regions where you have no recent travel history, unexpected cash withdrawals, and duplicate charges for the same item. Unauthorized changes to your contact information, such as email addresses or phone numbers associated with your account, are also critical warning signs.
        
Be wary if you receive notifications for login attempts from unknown devices or locations. Many banks now offer real-time alerts for such events. Immediate review and reporting of these notifications can prevent full account takeover.
        
Regularly reviewing your bank statements, transaction history, and credit card bills helps spot inconsistencies quickly. Even seemingly minor anomalies like unexpected service charges should be investigated.
        
Set up account notifications and use multi-factor authentication wherever possible. The earlier you recognize fraudulent activities, the easier it is to contain the damage and start remediation.
        
If in doubt, reach out to your bank’s fraud prevention department without delay. It’s better to report false alarms than to miss a real fraud incident.
