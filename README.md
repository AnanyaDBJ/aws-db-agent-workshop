Happy learning! ðŸŽ‰

Let me know if you'd like to add more details, such as specific workshop goals or advanced configurations!

participants will be running it in a databricks workspace , so i dont want them to run it locally. 
Thanks for clarifying! I'll adjust the README to reflect that participants should run the workshop in a Databricks Workspace rather than locally. Here's the updated README draft:
